# DA 210 -- Spring 2025 -- Homework 2.2 -- Professor Lavin

## Directions 

This assignment is a little bit different from the others.

1. Begin by creating a new repository under your account on Github.com. Name the repo `da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2` and select the option to add a `README.md` to the project.
2. You can make the repo public or keep it private and add me as a collaborator (username `mjlavin80`)
3. Clone the repository to your computer
4. Working locally, set up your project with: copies of all GSS data files from H-2 and a Jupyter Notebook file called `h-2.2.ipynb`   
5. Copy/paste the "Load Data" block and questions 1-4 below to your `h-2.2.ipynb` file. Make sure each question is in a separate markdown cell.
6. Below each question, input your response in either a code cell or a markdown cell
7. When you are finished, save your work, convert the Jupytext Notebook to .html format, and submit the `h-2.2.html` file on Canvas.
8. Push your updated `da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2` repo to Github.com.

__Reminders:__ 

- You are not permitted to get the answers from a classmate or to use Github Copilot, chatGPT, etc. on this homework. These exercises are for practice so, if you use outside help in a way that's not permitted, you are only cheating yourself out of a chance to learn and prepare for future quizzes and tests. 
- Working with an ARC tutor and visiting our TA's office hours are both permitted, but they should be provide advice and support, and you should not expect them to do your work for you.

## Load Data

Copy/paste the following code block to your live Notebook and make sure it runs without error:

```
import pandas as pd 

# load sample csv
df_gss_sample = pd.read_csv('data/gss_sample.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8') 

# load rows counts of full data
gss_full_row_counts = pd.read_csv('data/gss_full_row_counts.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load years per variable data
gss_years_per_var = pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_years_per_var.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load data dictionary
gss_data_dictionary =  pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_dictionary.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1')
```

---


```python
import pandas as pd 

# load sample csv
df_gss_sample = pd.read_csv('data/gss_sample.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8') 

# load rows counts of full data
gss_full_row_counts = pd.read_csv('data/gss_full_row_counts.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load years per variable data
gss_years_per_var = pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_years_per_var.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load data dictionary
gss_data_dictionary =  pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_dictionary.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1')
```

```python
##%pwd
## Thank you so much for your help in office hours!!
```

## Question 1

1. Working with `df_gss_sample`, create a variable called `mycols` that is a list of ten (10) column names that are related to one another in some way.
2. Create a new variable called `df_gss_sample_ten_cols` that contains only the ten (10) columns in `mycols`.
3. In a markdown cell below this question, explain how your variables are related to one another.

__Hint__: to find related variables, look at the variable names, the 'var_doc_label' column in `gss_data_dictionary` and/or the GSS Data Explorer at https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/.

```python
mycols = ['commute', 'hrs1', 'educ', 'sei', 'income', 'wrkgovt', 'wrkstat', 'class', 'satjob', 'finalter']
df_gss_sample_ten_cols = df_gss_sample[mycols]
df_gss_sample_ten_cols
```

My variables are related to one another for many reasons.  Years of education is connected to income and hours they work per week.  Income effects socioeconomic index and social class.  Job satisfaction is connected to employment status and income.  Financial situation is connected to income, hours worked per week, social class, etc. Wrkgovt (goverment vs private) influences social class status and income.  Commute reflects someone's income and social class apart from the significance of their job role.  Most of my selected variables are under the categories 'employment,' 'work,' and 'occupation' in the variable dictionary. I can go on and on about how all of these variables are interlinked and build off of one another.


## Question 2

In a markdown cell below this question, address the following:

- How does `gss_sample` relate to `gss_full_row_counts`? If we assume `gss_sample` is a sample of a larger dataset of GSS data, why would we want some information about the full rows counts from the dataset? 
- Generally speaking, what information is contained in the `gss_years_per_var` and `gss_data_dictionary` DataFrames? How can we use these sources to better understand our sample?



GSS sample is most likely a subset of the complete GSS dataset.  It only is a representation of the total data results.  Therefore it is a preview of the GSS full row counts data set and we can use the sample to infer results about the full row counts data set.  We would want some information about the full row counts to understand the legitimacey and the stories that the data tells us.  If we understand full row counts data, we can address bias and single out missing data in the larger data set.

The information contained is what years that the data was collected for each variable by the GSS.  It shows us trends related to attitude surrounding social issues.  Helps us find consistency and lack of missing data or results when surveying data across multi-year spans.  The dictionary helps us understand each variable and what it means.  It helps us accurately interpret the values in each cell.  Helps us decide what variables are and are not relevant to our analysis.


## Question 3

In a code cell below this question, use the `value_counts` method to display a count for each unique value found in the `zodiac` column of `df_gss_sample`. __Display the result as a `DataFrame`__.


```python
zodiac_counts = df_gss_sample['zodiac'].value_counts().reset_index()
zodiac_counts.columns = ['zodiac_sign', 'count']

zodiac_counts
```

## Question 4

In a code cell below this question, display a scatter plot depicting the `realinc` variable on one axis and the respondents occupational prestige score based on the 2010 Census occupation classification. 

__Hint:__ Pandas has some simple plotting options built into it, and the Seaborn library is designed to accept a pandas DataFrame as an input, sort of like (but not as good as) ggplot in R. Here are some resources on Pandas and Seaborn plots:

- Built-in plots: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#plotting
- Seaborn scatter plot: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize = (10, 4))
sns.scatterplot(data = df_gss_sample, x = 'realinc', y = 'prestg80', alpha = 0.5)

plt.xlabel('Real Income')
plt.ylabel('Occupational Prestige Score')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Real Income vs. Occupational Prestige')
plt.show
```
